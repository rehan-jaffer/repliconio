# Development Roadmap

# Framework being used
We're going to be using the Rails web framework for Ruby, version 4. 
The Ruby version we'll be using is 2.2.
Bower is being used to manage the frontend dependencies, via the bower-rails gem. The bower packages (which will need npm) can be found in the Bowerfile.
